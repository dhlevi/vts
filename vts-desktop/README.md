# VTS Desktop

This package is not currently functional.

This is an Electron implementation of the VTS Designer. It's a prototype... basically just a literal cut of the code, and is not suitable for any kind of use (outside of testing or as a curiousity) until some significant re-development is completed.

It is here for posterity, and will be developed as a prototype along with the rest of VTS. Depending on the lifespan of VTS as a prototype, eventually this code base will be replaced with something much more robust.
